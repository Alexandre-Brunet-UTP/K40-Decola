# GL Project : Decola 

This repository is used for the Decola project. 
The decola project submitted by the University of Poitiers in France. This project main purpose is to add functionality to the [K40 Whisperer](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html) software. To do that we are starting from the version vanilla software v0.56.

## The Teachers
This project is under the direction of 
- Laurent FUCHS
- Agn√®s ARNOULD
- Hakim Ferrier BELHAOUARI
- Marie Helene TOMLINSON

## The students 
We are currently six students working on this project :
- Alexandre BRUNET
- Arthur MICHEL
- Charly MENNETEAU
- Dylan PILARDEAU
- Oumar Farough BALDE
- Ossama AFKAR

## The goals 
During this project we have three main focusses :
- Allow the user to simulate a laser pass (run the hardware without the laser powered on).
- When importing a file, perform a filling with the imported shape to minimize the remaining blank area. (Translation only)
- Improve the above step with shape rotation so that more shape can be fed into the machine in one shot.

## Sources
The sources are resources for the software are located in the [src](https://github.com/Alexandre-Brunet-UTP/K40-Decola/tree/master/src) directory.
